My main research subjects are <span style="color:#f00909">**Fully Homomorphic Encryption**</span>, <span style="color:#f00909">**Multi-Party Computation**</span> and <span style="color:#f00909">**Cloud Computing**</span>. 
I am currently working as researcher at **DESILO Inc**. <br> 

I did a B.S. in Mathematics at University of Cagliari, Italy (2012) and a M.S. in Cryptology at University Joseph Fourier of Grenoble, France (2014). 
From 2015 to 2018 I was a PhD student in the Crypto team at the Laboratory of Mathematics of Versailles (Université Paris-Saclay), under the supervision of Louis Goubin and Nicolas Gama. I defended the PhD thesis _Towards efficient and secure Fully Homomorphic Encryption and cloud computing_ in May 2018. I've been also:
*	An ATER (research and teaching) at University of Versailles (UVSQ, Versailles, France) during the 2017-2018 accademic year.
*	A research intern in the Cryptography Research group at Microsoft Research (Redmond, WA, USA) during Summer 2018.
*	A visiting scientist for the [<span style="color:#f00909">Lattices: Algorithms, Complexity, and Cryptography</span>](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/lattices2020){:target="_blank"} program at Simons Institute (Berkeley, CA, USA) in January-February 2020.
* 	A Post-Doc in the COSIC research group in KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) from November 2018 and April 2020.
* 	**Cryptography Research Director** at Zama until November 2023.
